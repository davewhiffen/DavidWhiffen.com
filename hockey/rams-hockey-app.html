    <h4 class="font-weight-bold my-3">Rams Hockey App:<br> Current Build (2019) </h4>
    <p class="grey-text">Designer, Programmer</p>
    <p class="grey-text">This is the current 2019 build of the Rams Hockey app.  It's gone through a lot of updates, but we're pretty happy with it where it's at.
    
    <br>The home screen shows all the important information at a glance. 
    
    <br>We see a mini-calendar, showing the week at a glance.  Okay, games on Thursday and Saturday, as always.  Practice on Monday, optional praccy Tuesday, and Special Teams practice Wednesday.
    
    <br>I can quickly jump and look at a visual calendar, which shows me the year's schedule in a compact and visual format.
    
    <br>Home games are coloured blue, with road games in black.  Team logos are placed over the days we play that team.
    
    <br>So I can already see with January that we have a busy month.  Two homes games the first weekend, then two weekends on the road, incuding a trip to Lakehead the second week.
    
    <br>I can jump to previous months and see our results visually, and I can tap a game to jump right to watching video of that game.
    
    <br>I've also got a quick link to print my calendar, so I can put them up on the wall, and with another click I can open the live iCal calendar that integrates into my Calendar app on all devices.  
    
    <br>So if a game changes time, as soon as the coaches make a change, I get notified and it's in the system.  No missed practices or showing up late to games that were re-scheduled for earlier.
    
    <br>And iCal also sends me push notifications alerting me when to leave based on my current location.
    
    <br>It takes the chore or reading bulky schedules and makes it a better experience.
    
    <br>Now back to the main window.  Access to all video and analytics are one click away from the main menu, so I'm not looking around for those link locations through my email each time I want to check.  They're just right there.
    
    <br>The contacts section has all the phone and email information of the team inputted, so I can get a hold of a player if I need to.
    
    <br>The app opens Messages and Mail automatically, so I don't have to manually enter everyone's information.
    
    <br>I can also download everyone's contact information, the entire team's contact list, to my phone and iCloud account with a single click.
    
    <br>All staff are listed with their phone numbers as well, and if they have an office in the building, that office # is listed as well.
    
    
    <br>If I'm a brand new player to the team, I don't need a backpack full of documents and sheets for all the important team information.
    
    It's all contained in the Rams Hockey app.
    
    <br>Now as an additional feature, the Training Tools tab has a collection of various tools that I can learn more about.
    
    <br>It's also got links to Municipal Parking apps, Presto apps, GoTransit apps, and TTC transit apps, so I can have everything downloaded as I adapt to living in the city.
    
    
    <br>The team website is also linked into the app if I ever want to jump to it quickly.
    
    <br>Now in the League tab, all the important league-related information is stored here.
    
    <br>I can quickly jump to scores across every major league, or check on the league-wide standings.
    
    <br>There's also links to watch Live video of games, which brings links from several streaming websites together, as well as a Leaders tab and a teams directory.
    
    <br>The world map add every professional hockey team's rink to my Google Maps app, for both North America and Europe.
    
    <br>There's also a link to the depth charts of teams we pre-scout.
    
    <br>So overall, the Rams Hockey app takes all the digital elements of our team: the calendars, the schedules, the contacts, the pre-scouts, and puts them all in one place that's simple and easy to use.

    <p class="grey-text">These are standard player highlight videos.  We pull the scoring chances and important clips from the archives on Vidswap, compile them into a list.  
    
    <br>Because VidSwap doesn't let you add titles over top of the clips, and VidSwaps mobile apps aren't as simple as sending a YouTube link, we decided to just export the clips individually and add titles in iMovie.
    
    <br>That means that each clip has a title explaining the play and the result, and all the coaches have to do is send a link for the player.

    <h4 class="font-weight-bold my-3">Sportscode Window:<br> Early Build (2018) </h4>
    <p class="grey-text">Designer</p>
    <p class="grey-text">Now after our analytics systems were well defined and organized, I started to look towards video.
    
    Our video coach was having a hard time with the software, and given I have a degree in Media Production, I figured I'd help him get our new Sportscode software working through the expected bugs and errors.
    
    <br>Eventually I took over the Video Coach role as my main role, and began developing and improving the systems we had there.
    
    <br>I pushed pretty aggressively for our team to switch to Sportscode from STEVA.  I never liked STEVA, it looked like crappy PC software from the 90's.  It always crashed and the UI was just awful to use.  None of the coaches liked using it.
    
    <br>I saw that London was using Sportscode and I instantly loved the Code Window that allowed complete customization.
    
    After we switched to Sportscode, I threw together my own custom code window, using the Iconography system I had built.
    
    <br>Most code windows are just dozens of boxes with labels on them, and offer the main markers that coaches are looking for: goals for and against, powerplay and penalty kill, and faceoffs.
    
    <br>I began with those features, although I used my custom symbols instead of labels, and assigned the actions to specific keys.
    
    <br>I had recently bought a Chroma keyboard from Razer for my Macbook, and what I quickly realized was that if I used the Chroma keyboard, I could map custom colours and behaviors to each key.
    
    <br>That mean that I could use 1,2,3, Q,W,E, A,S,D, Z,X,C keys as forward player buttons, and IO, JK, ,. as defence player buttons.  The right number keypad allowed me to have goals scored, shots for and against, scoring chances all close to my fingers.
    
    <br>I could use NumPad 1,2,3 to mark the Zone (Defensive, Neutral, Offensive), and NumLock, 7, 4 and *, 9, 6 as Scoring chance quality.
    
    <br>I put the space bar as the clock start/stop, F1,F2 as faceoff wins and losses, and F3 and F4 as powerplay and penalty kill.
    
    <br>And because each key could have it's own behavior, the space bar lights up and flashes when it becomes active.
    
    <br>The Powerplay button flashes green and the player buttons light up yellow when active and blue when not.
    
    <br>Between the keyboard and the Code Window, there was enough visual feedback that I could track all these events happening simulataneously, and not fall behind.
    
    <br>I also mapped B and N as possession changes, which I classified just as breakouts, and used G and H as success or fail indicators.
    
    <br>This allowed me to mark all the important information of a game live, without being overwhelmed or making mistakes.
    
    <br>It's turned into a great system.  We only need one person tracking on one laptop, to get the tracking of several people and several devices from before.  
    
    <br>There's also a really satisfying rhythm to it.
    
    <br>Breakout, up the neutral zone to the offensive zone, scoring chance in the B area, missed shot. Possession change. Breakout failed.  Turnover. Scoring Chance A, Royal Road. Goal. Stop clock.
    
    <br>In 2018, I added passing indicators to the scoring chances, meaning we could differentiate chances even further based on the pass that occured beforehand. Where did the pass originate? Was the shot a one timer? Off the rush? Was it cross-crease? 
    
    <br>All that information is broken down into icons and buttons on the keyboard that I can key in as they happen.

    <h4 class="font-weight-bold my-3">Puck Possession App (2018)</h4>
    <p class="grey-text">Designer, Programmer</p>
    <p class="grey-text">After getting comfortable with our tracking metrics, I became interested in another statistic that would complement icetime:Puck Possession.  
    
    <br>But there wasn't an easy way to track this kind of information.  You could run a series of timers on your desktop, but for 20 or so players, jumping between them all was really cumbersome.
    
    <br>Eventually, I took the 'depth charts' idea and applied it to a custom app we made for iPad and desktop.
    
    <br>Every player had their colorized icon, and was in their slotted lines.  Tapping the player would start up a timer, and tapping another player, or tapping the same player, would stop that timer.
    
    We added an opposing team button and timer, and now we had a working way to track Puck Possession.
    
    <br>While the desktop versions do work, the best way to run this app is on iPad, where you can tap the icons and not struggle with a mouse.  It's much easier when you're clicking these timers hundreds of times a game.
    
    <br>Now with the game over with, we would copy the player's possession times and generate pie charts and comparison tables for extra analysis.
    
    <br>It became obvious who was making plays and who was throwing pizzas, because their possession times were much higher.  They were holding onto the puck, thinking, and waiting for a play to develop.
    
    <br>It's also interesting to compare possession times between your team and the opposing team, as well as a player's ice time in relation with the time they hold the puck.
    
    <br>Even for the best players, they would only have 1:30-2:00m of time actually holding the puck each game.
    
    <br>That's not a lot of time across 60 minutes of play.  It really drives home to the player the importance of thinking out there, making good decisions, and maximizing the time you get where you're actually in control of the puck.

    <p class="grey-text">Designer</p>
    <p class="grey-text">Another thing that was getting annoying for me was the pre-scout of other teams.  I'd always be doing the same thing.  Watch video, pull up the roster, figure out the line pairings, learn about their success on special teams, etc. etc.
    <br>It was a lot of information that was hard to visualize.  So I thought of a design that would take all the important information of a team and show it all on one page.  This was the birth of us using depth charts.
    <br>The Depth Charts are one pagers with visual lineup images, as well as the coaching breakdown and some interesting stats about the team.  It's made to answer the question, "If I'm a brand new player and know nothing about this team, what are all the important things I need to know?"
    <br>So the depth charts go further than just line combinations, they also colorize the player by their year, since experience in a league with 5 years of eligibility is important. So I used 5 colours to distinguish experience:
    
    <br>white=1st year 
    <br>green=2nd year
    <br>blue=3rd year
    <br>purple=4th year
    <br>yellow=5th year
    
      
    <br>What I also included was clear pictures of the player's faces, as well as a stick icon that pointed to the left or right based on their handedness.  
    
    <br>I also included a logo in the top right corner for each player to indicate if they had played Major Junior before.  
    
    <br>I also added a 'salute' icon for players who had been drafted.
    
    <br>All the coaching staff was included, and their overall record and important stats like powerplay percentage were also placed on the right side.
    
    <br>The depth charts took about the same time as it normally would for me to research and scout a team before a game, but now, I had an image I could visualize all the information on, organized in a way that made sense, and had something I could hand out to players before games to give them a quick snapshot of their organization.

    One of the more annoying things about hockey is finding different team's rinks.  Sure, you learn them after a few years, but the information from Google isn't always right and sometimes you end up going off a sheet of paper with a list of addresses like we originally had.
    
    <br>Using a Google MyMaps Extension, I placed the team logo over their respective area for all the teams in our league.  It made it much easier to visualize the divisions and where teams were located.
    
    <br>I eventually did this for the OHL, the CHL, the NCAA, the ECHL, the AHL and the NHL.  Once I could scroll with my hand through the world and look where teams were placed I was really motivated to expand the feature.
    
    <br>It's extremely satisfying to have all the pro league rink locations marked on your Google Maps app by logo, and I found myself jumping into the app to learn more about different teams and their locations.

    <p class="grey-text">
    
    Annoyed by the outdated nature of hockey player stat boxes, I built a rough build of a system that would fix the most annoying problems of reading large pages of boxed stats for players.  
    
    <br> They're not pretty, the boxes blend together, and it's easy to lose your place when looking at a lot of data.
     
    <br>I realized that the best way to display and communicate a player's progress over multiple years was to present it in a horizontal 'timeline view'.  
    
    That way, you can easily get an idea of a player's career in a few seconds without the risk of mis-reading.  Team logos and points are communicated clearly, so if you got traded mis-season, that is shown clearly on your timeline, and it doesn't look like you had a 20 goal season and a 15 goal season when you really had a 35 goal season.
